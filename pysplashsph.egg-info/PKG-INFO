Description: PySplashSPH
        ========
        
        A Python wrapper for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics plotting library SPLASH.
        Currently supports reading many SPH data formats, and useful exact analytic solutions
        for specific hydrodynamics problems.
        
        PySplashSPH currently does not wrap the SPLASH interpolation routines, however this
        is planned for a future release.

        ## Building/Installing from source
        Installing from source requires an installation of Splash. To install:
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        To build a python wheel:
        ```
        python setup.py bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        Note that this will automatically build the `splash` libraries and copy them into the correct location (`pysplashsph/libs/.`), however it will not "audit" or "delocate" the wheel (i.e. copy in and relink any non-standard external libraries that are dependencies).
        
        To build a 'fixed' wheel instead, run the script `build-wheels.sh`, which will build as well as audit the wheel for you. Fixed wheels are stored in `pysplashsph/wheelhouse`. You can choose to install directly from a wheel with `pip install <wheel-name>.whl`.
        
        ### Search paths
        `setup.py` will search for an installation of Splash in the following directories, in this order:
        
        1. In the current directory, i.e.
           ```
           pysplashsph/
              |--- README.md
              |--- pysplashsph/
              |--- setup.py
                ...
              |--- splash/
              ...
              |--- test/
              |--- wheelhouse/
           ```
        2. In the parent directory, i.e.
           ```
           splash/
              |--- bin/
              |--- build/
                ...
              |--- pysplashsph/
              ...
              |--- src/
           ```
        3. In the directory defined by the environment variable `$SPLASH_DIR`
        4. In `$HOME/splash`
