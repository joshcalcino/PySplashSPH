* Repo: https://www.github.com/joshcalcino/pysplash

PySPLASH is a Python interface to the smoothed particle hydrodynamics vizualisation
tool `SPLASH <https://github.com/danieljprice/splash>`_. It aims to make the core functionality
of SPLASH available for use in Python, combining the speed of Fortran with the
versitility of Python.
