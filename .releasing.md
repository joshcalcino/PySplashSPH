## Notes for making new releases

- New releases are automated via GitHub actions.
- GitHub actions will always try to upload successfully built wheels to PyPI, but will skip them if wheels with the same name/version already exist.
- Simply increment the version number in `__init__.py`, then commit and push
```
git add pysplashsph/__init__.py
git commit -m `updated version number`
git push
```
- For very, _very_ minor updates, do a post-release. e.g. `0.0.3-1 --> 0.0.3-2`.
- It's also a good idea to add a version tag to commits that trigger a new release.
```
git tag v0.0.3.post2
git push --tags
```

### Splash
The same version/commit of splash will be built/used unless you update the hash of the git submodule.
To update the hash:
- clone the repository with the `--recursive` option to populate the splash git submodule
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/joshcalcino/PySplashSPH.git
cd PySplashSPH
```
- If you've already cloned it WITHOUT `--recursive` then
```
cd PySplashSPH
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
- Next, checkout the latest copy of splash in the submodule (and/or move the HEAD to master)
```
cd splash
git checkout master
git fetch
git pull
```
- Then commit the updated hash
```
cd ..
git add splash
git commit -m 'updated splash'
git push
```
- Finally, remember to update the pysplashsph version number.
- It's probably a good idea to push the new hash, check if all the automated builds and tests succeed on github first, and THEN increment the version number to trigger a new release.
